# BinaryMatMul Library

This library implements a binary matrix multiplication algorithm. This library will use the BTPU present in the @alanmasu RISC-V Project. The library is designed to be used with the RISC-V architecture but will be provided some test souces that can be compiled using the GCC toolchain of the host architecture. The library will be used to test the BTPU and the RISC-V architecture.
